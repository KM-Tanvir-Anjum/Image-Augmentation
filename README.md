# Image-Augmentation
This script uses the **Augmentor** library to apply transformations like rotation, flipping, zooming, brightness/contrast adjustments, skew, and shear to images in `input_directory`. It generates 500 augmented images to increase dataset diversity, saving them in `output_directory` for enhanced ML model training.
